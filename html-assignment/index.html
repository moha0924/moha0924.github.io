            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Mohammed Faraz, I'm a student of <em><b>Interactive Media Design</b></em> currently in my 1<sup>st</sup> Semester. Before joining the program back in India, I used to work as an illustrator at one of the pop culture merchandise startups and while working there I chose to pursue my career in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. I always try to stay myself and just expand my comfort zone a little step at a time. And be proud of myself and the progress I made.
             </p>
             <p>The one thing I would love to own any time I want is my <b>Sony A6600 Camera</b>. It's like my best friend and I take it with me every time. It has helped me make connections with the world, with people, and with myself. I love photography because of the artistic freedom that I get from it. I can take a picture of anything and make it look even better with the way I manage the settings on my camera or with post-processing. This makes me feel very good about myself. I love how photography makes me feel more confident about myself and my place in the world.
